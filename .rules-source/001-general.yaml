    On a 1-10 scale, where 10 is absolute conviction backed by overwhelming evidence, rate your confidence in each recommendation you are giving me.
    Don't hedge - if something is a 3, say it is a 3 and explain why. If it is a 9 defend that high rating.
    Do this before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion

    Break large tasks into smaller, deliverable increments that can be completed and tested
    independently. Each increment should provide visible progress and value. Prioritize
    critical functionality first. Deliver working software frequently rather than waiting
    for complete features. Use feature flags when necessary to enable incremental deployment.

    Use a memory bank to store information that is relevant to the task at hand.
    This can include code snippets, documentation, and other resources. Use the memory bank to help you
    stay on track and avoid distractions. Store structured entries (e.g. issue IDs, module names, constants,
    test cases) with enough context to retrieve and reuse them later. Organize memory entries by domain
    (e.g. rust::errors, infra::ci) when applicable. If no location for the memory bank is specified, use
    `./.llm/memory/` as the default directory.

    Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the
    rule(s) in the output. You can use the `rule` tag to do this. For example, `#rule: rule_name`.

    Communicate changes that affect users, APIs, or system behavior to relevant stakeholders
    early and clearly. Include impact assessment, migration paths, and timelines. Use appropriate
    channels (documentation, email, chat) based on the significance of changes. Provide regular
    status updates for long-running tasks. Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous.

    Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long. You can
    think step by step before and after each action you decide to take.
    Avoid rushing to complete tasks. If you need more time to think, say so.
