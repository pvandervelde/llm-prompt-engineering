    When searching for files in the workspace make sure to also
    search hidden directories (e.g. `./.github`, `./.vscode`, etc.). But skip the `.git` directory.

    When running commands that take a long time to complete, wait for the command to finish before
    proceeding. If the command is still running, inform the user and wait for it to complete.
