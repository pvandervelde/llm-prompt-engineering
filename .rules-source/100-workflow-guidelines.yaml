    All code should be easy to understand and maintain. Use clear and descriptive
    names for variables, functions, and classes. Always follow the coding standards and best practices
    for the programming language being used.

    The coding task is not complete without documentation. All code should be
    well-documented. Use comments to explain the purpose of complex code and to provide context for
    future developers. Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules. The documentation
    should be clear and concise.

    Employ different test approaches to get good coverage of both happy path
    and error handling. Consider approaches like unit tests, property based testing, fuzz testing,
    integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests. Use the appropriate testing
    frameworks and tools for the programming language being used.

    Whenever you make a change, run the tests and fix any errors that are revealed. Fix one error at
    a time and provide an explanation of why you think the change you made fixes the error
