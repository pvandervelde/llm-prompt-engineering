    The branch name should be a brief summary of the changes being made. Branch
    names should be in lowercase and use hyphens to separate words. For example, `fix-bug-in-login-page`
    or `feature-add-new-user`.

    For commit messages the
    type should be one of the following: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`,
    `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`. The scope should be the name of the module or component being changed. The subject should
    be a short description of the change. The `work_item_ref` is one of the following issue references:
    `references` or `related to` followed by the issue number.
    Finally those parts make the following format for commit messages:

    ```text
    type(scope): subject

    description

     references <work_item_ref>
    ```
