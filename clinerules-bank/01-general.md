# General Guidelines

All rules are to be followed in all projects. The rules are divided into categories for better organization.
Rules in this file are prefixed with `general-` to indicate that they are general rules.

## Behaviour

1. **general-mention-rules-used**: Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the
   rule(s) in the output. You can use the `rule` tag to do this. For example, `#rule: rule_name`.
   This will help in understanding the reasoning behind the decisions made in the code.
2. **general-mention-knowledge**: List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before
   completing this task.
3. **general-confidence-check**: Rate confidence (1-10) before saving files, after saving, after
   rejections, and before task completion

## Tool use

1. **general-tool-use-os**: Use operating system relevant tools when possible. For example, use
   `bash` on Linux and MacOS, and `powershell` on Windows
