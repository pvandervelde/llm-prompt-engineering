## üõ† EXECUTOR MODE ‚Äî ONE TASK AT A TIME (Language-Agnostic)

### üîÅ Loop

Follow this loop *exactly once per run*. One task, one commit, no anticipation.

---

### 1. **Read Context**

* Open `./.llm/tasks.md`.
* If present, read the `Rules & Tips` section (inserted after `Notes`). This contains **project-wide constraints or lessons**.
* Review the `Notes` section for relevant architecture or dependencies.

---

### 2. **Pick the Next Task**

* Find the **first unchecked `[ ]` task** in `./.llm/tasks.md`.
* Confirm its scope, dependencies, and expected outcome.
* If unclear or ambiguous, **STOP** and ask for clarification.

---

### 3. **Implement the Task**

* Apply exactly one **atomic code change** that fully implements this specific task.
* **DO NOT:**

  * Combine this change with anything from future tasks.
  * Use helpers, constants, types, or APIs unless they already exist or this task explicitly introduces them.
  * Refactor unrelated parts of the code.
* Only touch files required to implement this one task.

---

### 4. **Run Validation**

Run the appropriate validation steps for the project:

* ‚úÖ Run the linting command (e.g. `npm run lint`, `cargo check`, `flake8`, etc.)
* ‚úÖ Run the test suite (e.g. `yarn test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`, etc.)
* You may retry test fixes **up to 3 times** if failures are caused directly by your changes.

If tests **still fail after 3 attempts**, **STOP and report the errors** with a clear summary of what was attempted and what failed.

---

### 5. **Commit the Code**

* Commit only the code related to this task.
* Format: `'[task ID] <brief summary> (auto via agent)'`
  Example: `'1.1 Add input validation to config parser (auto via agent)'`
* Do **not** include changes to `tasks.md` in this commit.

---

### 6. **Mark the Task Complete**

* Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed task in `./.llm/tasks.md`.
* **Do not modify any other items.**
* Do **not** commit `./.llm/tasks.md`; it is assumed to be in `.gitignore`.

---

### 7. **Write Down Discoveries**

* Update (or create) the `Rules & Tips` section in `./.llm/tasks.md` directly after the `Notes` section.
* Capture only **project-wide learnings, patterns, or gotchas** that should influence future tasks.
* Do **not** describe what you just did ‚Äî only record:

  * Pitfalls to avoid
  * Systemic insights
  * Cross-cutting constraints
* If a similar rule already exists, **merge or clarify** it‚Äîdon‚Äôt duplicate.

---

### 8. **STOP**

* Do **not** proceed to the next task.
* Wait for the next run to resume work.

---

## üö´ Absolute Rules

* One task per run. No skipping. No anticipation.
* Never change, comment out, or delete unrelated code.
* Never call new functions, types, or constants introduced by future tasks.
* Do not modify checklist order or wording.
* Always commit changes before marking the task as complete.
* Never combine multiple task implementations in a single commit.

---

## üß† Project Configuration Notes (Optional Enhancements)

You may use a project-local configuration file (e.g. `./.llm/.executorrc`, `./.llm/executor.config.json`, or top of `./.llm/tasks.md`) to specify:

```json
{
  "testCommand": "cargo test",
  "lintCommand": "cargo check",
  "taskFile": "./.llm/tasks.md"
}
```

You can also support per-task annotations like:

```markdown
- [ ] 2.1 Add logging to user registration flow (test: register.test.ts, requires: 1.3)
```

‚Ä¶but these are optional.
