## üéØ Task

You are an expert DevOps engineer and automation specialist tasked with analyzing a repository and generating a
comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow file for development environment setup. Your goal is to create a workflow
that enables GitHub Copilot and other developers to quickly initialize and configure the development environment
for any repository.

## üìã Workflow Requirements

Generate a GitHub Actions workflow file named `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` that includes a single
job called `copilot-setup-steps`. This workflow should handle comprehensive environment initialization covering the
following areas:

### 1. Development Environment Setup

- **Operating system** detection and configuration
- **Runtime environments** (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, etc.)
- **Package managers** (npm, pip, cargo, maven, etc.)
- **Environment variables** and configuration
- **System dependencies** and tools

### 2. Dependencies Installation

- **Primary dependencies** from package files
- **Development dependencies** for tooling
- **Global tools** and utilities
- **Optional dependencies** for specific features
- **Cache management** for faster subsequent runs

### 3. Testing Environment Configuration

- **Test frameworks** setup and configuration
- **Test databases** or mock services
- **Test data** initialization
- **Coverage tools** configuration
- **Performance testing** tools (if applicable)

### 4. Code Quality Tools Setup

- **Linters** and static analysis tools
- **Code formatters** and style checkers
- **Security scanners** and vulnerability checks
- **Documentation generators** and validators
- **Pre-commit hooks** installation

### 5. Repository-Specific Setup

- **Build artifacts** preparation
- **Configuration files** generation
- **Database migrations** or schema setup
- **Service dependencies** initialization
- **Custom tooling** or scripts execution

## üîç Repository Analysis Instructions

### Step 1: Technology Stack Detection

1. **Identify primary languages** by examining:
   - File extensions in the repository
   - Package files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, etc.)
   - Configuration files (`.nvmrc`, `runtime.txt`, `Dockerfile`, etc.)
   - Build files (`Makefile`, `build.gradle`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc.)

2. **Determine runtime requirements**:
   - Language versions and compatibility
   - Framework dependencies
   - System-level requirements

### Step 2: Build System Analysis

1. **Examine build configurations**:
   - Build scripts in package files
   - Dedicated build tools (webpack, rollup, gradle, etc.)
   - Compilation requirements
   - Asset processing needs

2. **Identify automation tools**:
   - Task runners (npm scripts, make targets, etc.)
   - CI/CD configurations for reference
   - Development servers or watch modes

### Step 3: Testing Infrastructure Review

1. **Discover testing frameworks**:
   - Test configuration files
   - Test directories and file patterns
   - Testing dependencies in package files
   - Mock or fixture requirements

2. **Analyze quality tools**:
   - Linter configurations (`.eslintrc`, `pylint.cfg`, etc.)
   - Formatter settings (`.prettierrc`, `black.toml`, etc.)
   - Static analysis tools configuration

### Step 4: Development Workflow Assessment

1. **Review development scripts**:
   - Available npm/yarn scripts
   - Make targets or similar automation
   - Development server configurations
   - Database setup scripts

2. **Examine documentation**:
   - Setup instructions in README files
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Development environment documentation

## üìù Workflow Generation Guidelines

### Workflow Structure

Generate a workflow using this template structure:

```yaml
name: Copilot Development Environment Setup

# Automatically run the setup steps when they are changed to allow for easy validation, and
# allow manual testing through the repository's "Actions" tab
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml

  # Set the permissions to the lowest permissions possible needed for your steps.
  # Copilot will be given its own token for its operations.
  permissions:
    # If you want to clone the repository as part of your setup steps, for example to install dependencies,
    # you'll need the `contents: read` permission. If you don't clone the repository in your setup steps, Copilot
    # will do this for you automatically after the steps complete.
    contents: read

jobs:
  copilot-setup-steps:
    name: Setup Development Environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Adjust based on repository requirements

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Environment setup steps based on repository analysis
      # Dependencies installation
      # Testing environment configuration
      # Code quality tools setup
      # Repository-specific initialization
```

### Key Principles to Follow

1. **Be Repository-Specific**: Tailor the workflow to the actual technologies and tools used
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects needed for development
3. **Be Efficient**: Use caching and optimization strategies
4. **Be Reliable**: Include error handling and validation steps
5. **Be Flexible**: Support different setup scopes (basic, full, testing)
6. **Be Documented**: Include clear comments explaining each step

### Required Workflow Features

#### Input Parameters

- **setup_scope**: Allow different levels of setup (basic, full, testing)
- **Additional inputs** as needed for repository-specific configuration

#### Cache Management
